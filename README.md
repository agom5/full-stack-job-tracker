## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need to set up and run both the backend server and the frontend client.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/full-stack-job-tracker.git](https://github.com/your-username/full-stack-job-tracker.git)
    cd full-stack-job-tracker
    ```

2.  **Set up and run the backend:**
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file.

3.  **Set up and run the frontend:**
    - In a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file.

Once both are running, you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by your frontend server).
